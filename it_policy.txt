--- IT Policy and Security Guidelines ---

**I. Access and Security:**
For VPN access, contact the help desk at extension 555. The recommended password length is 12 characters, and it must include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be changed every 90 days. All work devices must have up-to-date antivirus software provided by the IT department.

**II. Equipment and Assets:**
Employees are issued a laptop and external monitor. Requests for additional equipment, such as specialized graphics cards or software licenses (e.g., Adobe, AutoCAD), must be pre-approved by the department head and submitted to purchasing@company.com. All company assets must be returned to IT upon separation.

**III. Data Handling and Confidentiality:**
Sensitive customer data (Level 3 or higher) must only be stored on encrypted network drives, never on local hard drives. For technical assistance, email helpdesk@company.com. If your password expires, use the self-service portal at portal.company.com/reset.

**IV. Remote Work Guidelines:**
All remote workers must utilize the company VPN for all access to internal systems. Personal devices are strictly prohibited from accessing Level 3 data.

**VI. Device Return Procedure:**
Upon separation, employees must return all company-issued devices (laptops, monitors, cell phones) to the IT department within 7 business days. A prepaid shipping label will be provided upon notification of separation.
